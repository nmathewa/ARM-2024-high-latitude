## Science Question(s)
1) How do aerosol (concentration, CCN, IN) conditions vary between the sites?
2) How do boundary layer (surface fluxes, turbulence) and cloud structures (cell type, characteristic size, phase) vary between sites?


## Project Scope (what does success look like)?
- Identification of areas of similarity or difference for CAO cases at the two sites


## Hypothesis (or Hypotheses)
- CCN and aerosol concentration will be smaller than average the day after events due to precipitation scavenging
- Cold air outbreak index will be positively correlated with surface flux and wind direction/intensity
- Clouds at NSA will have different physical formation and be less glaciated due to younger age


## Datasets
- Aerosol concentration, CCN, IN
- Fluxes + turbulence
- radar/lidar cloud profiles
- INTERPSONDE
- Model output regarding microphysical processes

## Prior Knowledge/References
- The season for cold air outbreaks varies between sites; early spring for COMBLE and late fall for NSA
